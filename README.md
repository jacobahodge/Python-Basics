# Python-Collection Types and Practice
**Collection = single “variable” used to store multiple objects.**
- ***Not one of the 4 data types***

**Lists = [ ]** 
- **ordered and changeable. Duplicates are allowed.**
- A sequenced collection of different objects such as integers, strings, and even other lists as well.
- The address of each element within a list is called an **index**.
    - An index is used to access and refer to items within a list.

**Sets = { }** 
- Unordered, immutable, and unindexed.
- Duplicates are NOT allowed.
- Adding and removing indices is allowed.
- Note: True and 1 are considered the same value as are False and 0 in a set.

**Tuples = ( )** 
- **Ordered and immutable. Duplicates are allowed. Faster for processing.**
- Can contain different data types.

**#Dictionaries { } **
- Used to store key-value pairs.
- The keys have to be immutable and unique and are often characters.
- Dictionaries support any data type.
